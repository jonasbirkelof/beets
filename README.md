# Welcome to the Beets project!

The project Beets started out as an addon to the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) library. Adding classes that I found missing or lacking in the otherwise fully featured css library gave me a better workflow as components and functions I often used became more accessible. Now this is called [Beets CSS](https://github.com/jonasbirkelof/beets-css).

Later came [Beets Layout](https://github.com/jonasbirkelof/beets-layout) wich provided a scaffolding system for web apps developed with Bootstrap (and Beets CSS). The idea behind this library was to give the user a good starting point for any kind of website, regardless if it's a single page layout or a dashboard with features like collapsing sidebar and header. The goal was also to make it modular and easy to configure with a couple of styles for the sidebar navigation.

As a PHP developer I found myself creating the same tools, login scripts and classes over and over again. Also my competence developed and I wanted to improve my previous projects with my newly found knowledge. One thing lead to another and a mini-framework was born, entering [Beets PHP](https://github.com/jonasbirkelof/beets-php). This small PHP framework includes a router ([Braums router](https://github.com/bramus/router)), autoloading, user administration functionality, form validation, SCSS-compiler, .env and more!

This project is always growing and developing. Right now my primary focus is on Beets PHP, but please feel free to use every part of this project and give feedback on GitHub!
