Beets Layout is a CSS and JavaScript library that gives you a good fundation for the layout in your HTML or PHP projects. The focus is set on dashboards but you can easily modify it to make it work with standard websites or single page applications.

This library is not meant to give you every configuration option at your fingertip, but rather give you a complete starting point. You do have some options, i.e. on the looks of the header and sidebar.

To get the quickest and best experience, you should use Beets Layout together with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), although you can easily modify it to work with any fornt-end framework like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

!!! tip "Consider using Beets Layout with **[Beets CSS](https://github.com/jonasbirkelof/beets-css)** and **[Beets PHP](https://github.com/jonasbirkelof/beets-php)**"

Beets Layout is developed using Boostrap 5.2.X.
