Beets PHP is a micro framework, scaffolding and jump start to your own PHP projects. Beets PHP uses a RESTful aproach with an MVC filesystem and includes a router, autoloader, SCSS compiler, Browser-sync, Docker compatibility, a complete user administration system and more!

Also included is [Beets CSS](https://github.com/jonasbirkelof/beets-css) and [Beets Layout](https://github.com/jonasbirkelof/beets-layout) which together with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) provides you with a completely designed user interface with collapsing sidebar, color adjustments and custom components. This being said, Beets PHP is framework agnostic so if you don't fancy Bootstrap, you can just install [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) or whatever you want!
