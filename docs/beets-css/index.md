Beets CSS is a CSS addon-library that is dependent on the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework. You will have to install Bootstrap for this library to work.

The porpose of Beets CSS is to tweek the already great Bootstrap framework and give it a somewhat new feel and some new functions. Beside a number of subtle design changes there are new button types, cursor classes and dropdown functions. Please refer to the documentation to learn more about what is different from the default Bootstrap experience.

Bootstrap is open source and because of that Beets CSS is also open source. On the projects [GitHub page](https://github.com/jonasbirkelof/beets-css) you can access all of the source files and tweek it yourself as you wish.
